# Web scrapping and GeoSpatial data processing
This repo scrapes species names records from AMNH website, 
splits a master shapefile into per‑feature layers, counts species per feature, and extracts climate variables from raster layers for downstream analysis
The codes are part of the analysis for the paper Silveira, Priscila; De Sousa, Fernanda Gonçalves ; Böning, Philipp ; Maciel, Natan M. ; Stropp, Juliana ; Lötters, Stefan. Do aposematic species have larger range sizes? A case study with neotropical poison frogs. Journal of Biogeography, v. 51, p. 1481-1489, 2024.
